            <p>The Belvedere Preparatory School was originally founded in 1880 as the Junior Department of The Belvedere School, Liverpool. <br />
                Originally housed at 17 Belvidere Road, we moved to our current premises at 23 Belvidere Road in 1939. It is widely recognised as one of the best Independent Schools in Liverpool.
                The Belvedere Preparatory School is an Independent Co-Educational School, for pupils aged 3-11 years. Our School is housed in a beautiful Victorian mansion which is located in a historically rich area of Liverpool.

                <h4>‘Belvedere School, Cairo: empowering education beyond all boundaries.’</h4>
                <p>Welcome to Belvedere School, Cairo where every child matters.</p>
                <p>Here, we are all strong believers in that all children learn well when draped in care and respect within a stimulating environment- one that addresses their innate curious natures. Curiosity is, after all, the key to igniting their world; a world of endless possibilities for learning and growing.</p>
                <p>At Belvedere School, Cairo, we recognize that education is the cornerstone of societal growth and the foundation for thriving communities. At Belvedere, we believe that education extends beyond the confines of the school, encompassing the holistic development and enlightenment of each individual child, one day and one lesson at a time. Our educational approach places a strong emphasis on nurturing qualities that make one a good human being. Additionally, it embraces the integration of technology while emphasizing the value of hands-on skills and creativity. By mastering these aspects, every student at Belvedere becomes uniquely empowered to excel in the future world. We prioritize equipping every learner and staff member with the essential skill of learning how to learn. In a constantly evolving world, the path forward lies in the ability to continuously learn, unlearn, and relearn. This commitment to ongoing growth and development is what we pledge to deliver to our stakeholders at Belvedere School.</p>
                <p>At Belvedere School Cairo, We Prepare for Life.</p>
